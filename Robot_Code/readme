This Folder contains the python script for the robot magic show from my TEEP intership.
It required other nodes and modules to be executed on the robotis OP3.
This repository acts as reference for the other NTNU master students further improving on the project in the future.

Please note that there are bugs in the hand tracking implementation inside the robot code. I recommend referring to the method cath_input() inside the finger
tracking module for the correct implementation using the cv_camera node on the OP3.
Thank you!
